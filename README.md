# himawaripy
*Put near-realtime picture of Earth as your desktop background*

himawaripy is a Python 3 script that fetches near-realtime (10 minutes delayed)
picture of Earth as its taken by
[Himawari 8 (ひまわり8号)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himawari_8) and sets it
as your desktop background.

Set a cronjob that runs in every 10 minutes to automatically get the
near-realtime picture of Earth.

## Supported Desktop Environments
### Tested
* Unity 7
* Mate 1.8.1
* Pantheon
* LXDE
* Windows (7)

### Not Tested
* GNOME 3
* KDE
* OS X

### Not Supported
* any other desktop environments that are not mentioned above.

## Configuration
You can configure the level of detail, by modifying the script. You can set the
global variable `level` to `4`, `8`, `16`, or `20` to increase the quality (and
thus the file size as well). Please keep in mind that it will also take more
time to download the tiles.

You can also change the path of the latest picture, which is by default
`~/.himawari/himawari-latest.png`, by changing the `output_file` variable.

### xfce4

On xfce4, you can set which displays you want to change the background of using
the xfce\_displays variable. If you get an error and you're not sure which
display to use, you can find your display in the output of

    xfconf-query --channel xfce4-desktop --list | grep last-image

### Nitrogen
If you use nitrogen for setting your wallpaper, you have to enter this in your
`~/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg`.

## Installation

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/boramalper/himawaripy.git
    
    # configure
    cd ~/himawaripy
    vi himawaripy.py
    
    # install
    sudo python setup.py install

    # test whether it's working
    himawaripy

    # set up a cronjob
    crontab -e

    # Get the installation path of himawaripy by running the command
    #    which -- himawaripy
    # on another terminal

    # Add the line:
    */10 * * * * <INSTALLATION_PATH>

    # or, alternatively use the provided systemd timer
    cp systemd/himawaripy.{service,timer} $HOME/.config/systemd/user/
    # enable and start the timer
    systemctl --user enable --now himawaripy.timer
    
### For KDE Users
> So the issue here is that KDE does not support changing the desktop wallpaper
> from the commandline, but it does support polling a directory for file changes
> through the "Slideshow" desktop background option, whereby you can point KDE
> to a folder and have it load a new picture at a certain interval.
>
> The idea here is to:
>
> * Set the cron for some interval (say 9 minutes)
> * Open Desktop Settings -> Wallpaper -> Wallpaper Type -> Slideshow
> * Add the `~/.himawari` dir to the slideshow list
> * Set the interval check to 10 minutes (one minute after the cron, also
>   depending on your download speed)

Many thanks to [xenithorb](https://github.com/xenithorb) [for the solution](https://github.com/xenithorb/himawaripy/commit/01d7c681ae7ce47f639672733d0f734574662833)!

## Uninstallation
    # remove the cronjob
    crontab -e
    # Remove the line
    */10 * * * * /home/USERNAME/himawaripy/himawaripy.py

    # or if you used the systemd timer
    systemctl --user disable --now himawaripy.timer
    rm $HOME/.config/systemd/user/himawaripy.{timer,service}

    # Remove the data directory
    # By default, `~/.himawari`. Check `output_file` variable in himawaripy.py
    # in case you've changed it.
    rm -rf ~/.himawari

    # Uninstall the package
    sudo pip uninstall himawaripy
